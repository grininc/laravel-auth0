# Octane Support

Octane compatibility with the SDK is currently considered experimental and is not supported.

Although we are working toward ensuring the SDK has full compatibility in the future, we do not recommend using this with our SDK in production until we have full confidence and announced support. There is an opportunity for problems we have not fully identified or addressed yet.

Feedback and bug-fix contributions are greatly appreciated as we work toward full support.
